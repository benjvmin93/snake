# The game

Simple snake game on Linux terminal using ncurses C library. I started it for fun and to distract myself.

# Setup

You need to install ncurses library on Linux device according to your distribution.
For example on Ubuntu you need to type : `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

# Start a game

1. `make`
2. `./snake`

# Next features

- Adapt the snake's body caracters currently setted to '~'. It could be cool to adapt them to the direction they go.
